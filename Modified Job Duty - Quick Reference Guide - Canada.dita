    <title>TeamWorks â€“ Modified Duty Job Code - Quick Reference Guide</title>

            <p>Note: Modified Duty is to be used only to account for work hours associated with
                accommodating a partner injured by a workplace incident and is not to be used when
                accommodating a partner due to their personal medical needs. Questions about this
